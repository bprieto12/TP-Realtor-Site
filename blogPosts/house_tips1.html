    <div class="big-letter">L</div><div class="texty">et me begin by telling you a story about friends of mine, Joe and Joanne Smith (names have obviously been changed). The couple had their eye on a neighborhood so naturally they were excited when they saw the open house sign in the front yard of a lovely two story home. Upon entering the house, they met with the agent holding the open house “Bob”. Bob was a pleasant man. He told Joe and Joanne to take their time and to let him know if they had any questions. After the tour, Joe and Joanne decided they had to have this house. They asked “Bob” to write up an offer, the offer submitted and accepted a day later. Off to escrow they went. <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Everything seemed fine at the time, then escrow closes (late, by the way). No more than a month in their new home, Joanne sees a water spot on the ceiling. She realized it is coming from one the second story bathroom. A few days later, another water spot in a different location...yikes!!! This leak was coming from yet another upstairs bathroom. Is it possible two of their three bathrooms have leaks, thought Joanne. They immediately called out the plumber. After inspection, poor Joe and Joanne found out that the showers in all three bathrooms were installed incorrectly and would have to be redone at a cost of $9,000. <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp “Bob” was a very nice man but did I mention that was related to the seller. A fact that was not disclosed at any time during the transaction. So, ask yourself, who’s interest was “Bob” truly representing? Regardless of who you choose, it is imperative that everyone has their own representation. <br>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is just one of many stories, I could go on. While working as an escrow officer I was witness to many unfortunate experiences for buyers, typically because they did not have their own representation. Early on, we (Bryan and I) too, made the mistake of purchasing a home without our own agent and things went very wrong for us as well. This is most likely the largest investment you will ever make so be sure to find an agent who will listen to your wants and needs and most importantly that one will protect your interests. <br>
     <bold>Bottom Line<bold><br>
     Famous sayings become famous because they are true. You get what you pay for. Just like a good accountant or a good attorney, a good agent will save you money...not cost you money.</div>
